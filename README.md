LRU Cache Implementation
Overview
This repository contains an implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache. The LRU Cache is a type of data structure that removes the least recently used items when the cache reaches its capacity. Itâ€™s often used to optimize systems where storage is limited, and frequently accessed data needs to be kept readily available.

Features
Efficient Cache Management: The cache stores key-value pairs and automatically evicts the least recently used items when the cache exceeds its capacity.

O(1) Time Complexity: Both insertions and lookups are done in constant time.

Eviction Strategy: Least recently used items are evicted to free space for newer entries.

Data Structures Used
Doubly Linked List: Keeps track of the order of usage of cache items.

Hash Map: Provides quick access to the cache items and their respective nodes in the doubly linked list.
